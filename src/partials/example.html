    plugin allows you to add code from other HTML files (fragments) to HTML page
    files. Fragments are stored in the <code>src/partials</code> folder. The
    addition occurs when compiling page files, such as <code>index.html</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This <code>example.html</code> file is an example of such a snippet, with
    the markup of a certain part of the main page. This is very convenient for
    team development on student projects, when several people write in one HTML
    file at once.
  </p>

  <p>
    The syntax for adding a fragment to the main file is:
    <code> &lt;include src="./partials/filename.html"&gt;&lt;/include&gt;</code>
  </p>

  <div class="background"></div>
